    <div class="desc"><h3><b>Jocelyn Bell Burnell &#127756</b></h3>
      <p>The New York Times: <q>Growing up in a Quaker household, Jocelyn Bell Burnell was raised to believe that she had as 
        much right to an education as anyone else. But as a girl in the 1940s in Northern Ireland, 
        her enthusiasm for the sciences was met with hostility from teachers and male students. <br> In 1967, Burnell made a discovery that altered our perception of the universe. 
        As a Ph.D. student at Cambridge University assisting the astronomer Anthony Hewish, she 
        discovered pulsars — compact, spinning celestial objects that give off beams of radiation, like cosmic lighthouses.</q>

      <h3><b>Sebastião Salgado &#128247</b></h3>
      <p>"(...) Brazilian social documentary photographer and photojournalist.<br>
        In September and October 2007, Salgado displayed his photographs of coffee workers from India, Guatemala, Ethiopia and Brazil at the Brazilian Embassy in London. 
        The aim of the project was to raise public awareness of the origins of the popular drink." (Wikipedia)</p>

      <h3><b>Robert Bilott &#128689</b></h3><h4>"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare"</h4>
      <p>"American environmental attorney from Cincinnati, Ohio. Bilott is known for the lawsuits against DuPont on behalf of plaintiffs from West Virginia. 
        Bilott has spent more than twenty years litigating hazardous dumping of the chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).<br><br>
        After the independent scientific panel jointly selected by the parties (but required under the settlement to be paid for by DuPont) found that there was a probable 
        link between drinking PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia, and ulcerative colitis, Bilott began opening
         individual personal-injury lawsuits against DuPont on behalf of affected users of the Ohio and West Virginia water supplies, which by 2015 numbered over 3,500. 
         After winning the first three for $19.7 million, in 2017 DuPont agreed to settle the remainder of the then-pending cases for $671.7 million. Dozens of 
         additional cases filed after the 2017 settlement were settled in 2021 for an additional $83 million (announced in conjunction with a $4 billion settlement 
         between DuPont and its spin-off, Chemours, over PFAS liabilities), bringing the total settlement value in the personal injury cases for those exposed to PFOA 
         in their drinking water to over $753 million." (Wikipedia)<br>

        <p>"English rock band formed in London in 1964. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, 
            they were distinguished for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. 
            They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time."</q>

      <div class="desc"><h3><b>Led Zeppelin &#127776</b></h3>
        <p>English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist 
              John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock 
              and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been 
              credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) 
              and stadium rock. Many critics consider Led Zeppelin one of the most innovative and influential rock groups in history.

        <p>"British rock band formed in London in 1970. Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), 
            Brian May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon (bass). Their earliest works were 
            influenced by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional 
            and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock."</p>
