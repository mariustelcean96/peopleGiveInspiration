      <p>The New York Times: <q>Growing up in a Quaker household, Jocelyn Bell Burnell was raised to believe that she had as 
        much right to an education as anyone else. But as a girl in the 1940s in Northern Ireland, 
        her enthusiasm for the sciences was met with hostility from teachers and male students. <br> In 1967, Burnell made a discovery that altered our perception of the universe. 
        As a Ph.D. student at Cambridge University assisting the astronomer Anthony Hewish, she 
        discovered pulsars — compact, spinning celestial objects that give off beams of radiation, like cosmic lighthouses.</q>

      <p>National Geographic: "He worked very hard for his students, got them jobs, worried about their education, many of them very well placed now," says William Poundstone, author of Carl Sagan: A Life in the Cosmos. "If you talk to the people he inspired, who knew him, they are uniformly effusive."<br><br>
        "Part of what made him great was the number of things he pursued," says NASA's David Morrison, director of the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe, at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. Morrison marveled both at Sagan's breadth of accomplishments and his lack of self-importance.<br><br>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/660/carl-sagan-1934-1996/">NASA</a>.<br>

      <h3><b>Robert Bilott &#128689</b></h3><h4>"The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare"</h4>
      <p>"American environmental attorney from Cincinnati, Ohio. Bilott is known for the lawsuits against DuPont on behalf of plaintiffs from West Virginia. 
        Bilott has spent more than twenty years litigating hazardous dumping of the chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).<br><br>
        After the independent scientific panel jointly selected by the parties (but required under the settlement to be paid for by DuPont) found that there was a probable 
        link between drinking PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia, and ulcerative colitis, Bilott began opening
         individual personal-injury lawsuits against DuPont on behalf of affected users of the Ohio and West Virginia water supplies, which by 2015 numbered over 3,500. 
         After winning the first three for $19.7 million, in 2017 DuPont agreed to settle the remainder of the then-pending cases for $671.7 million. Dozens of 
         additional cases filed after the 2017 settlement were settled in 2021 for an additional $83 million (announced in conjunction with a $4 billion settlement 
         between DuPont and its spin-off, Chemours, over PFAS liabilities), bringing the total settlement value in the personal injury cases for those exposed to PFOA 
         in their drinking water to over $753 million." (Wikipedia)<br>
